<br>Solutions for the 0/1 knapsack problem

* Dynamic Programming (HW2)
* Backtracing (HW3)
* Branch & Bound (HW3)

## Problem description
- Given 𝑛 items and a "knapsack.”
- Item 𝑖 has weight 𝑤<sub>𝑖</sub> > 0 and has value 𝑣<sub>𝑖</sub> > 0.
- Knapsack has capacity of 𝑊.
- Goal: Fill knapsack so as to maximize total value.

## Samples
`samples/` contain 7 samples in csv format of (value, weight) pairings.
2 cases are simple tests while there are an additional 5 test cases with the files named `test#_capacity_(optimal value)`. 
<br>These samples were refernced from *table 1* of https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349878676_A_Phase_Angle-Modulated_Bat_Algorithm_with_Application_to_Antenna_Topology_Optimization

Only the 5 samples for the 0/1 knapsack problem were referenced to test the code and no has other connection.
