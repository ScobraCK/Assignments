# Socket Programming
Computer Networks HW
<br>Simple socket programming using python

Assignment should show the basic socket functions such as socket() bind(), listen() etc so socketserver will not be used and be kept simple.

## Problem 1: Return Ascii code of message
Simple problem to show how TCP sockets works
## Problem 2: File IO
Client will be able to read or write files(.txt) by using connection. Server and Client will need to communicate depending on the request(read/write).

May have security risks so only will be tested on localhost.

## Problem 3: DNS
Server will act as a simple DNS host with id-domain_name mappings. A DB(sqlite3) will be used to save and query data.
